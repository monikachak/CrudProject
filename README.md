Certainly, here's an explanation of My Employee Management Application built with React JS and Json-server as the database:

Create Employee: Users can add new employees to the system. This feature likely includes a form where users can input employee details like name, position, and contact information.

List Employee: The app displays a list of all employees currently in the database. Users can easily view and search through the employee records.

Update Employee: Users have the ability to edit and update the information of existing employees. This is typically done through a form that pre-fills with the employee's current data.

Delete Employee: Users can remove employees from the database, effectively deleting their records.

Json-server Database: The app uses Json-server as the backend database. Json-server is a lightweight REST API server that stores data in JSON format. It's suitable for small-scale applications like this one.

In summary, My Employee Management Application offers a user-friendly interface for managing employee records, including adding, viewing, updating, and deleting employee data, all powered by a Json-server backend for data storage and retrieval.
